# Distance-between-Cities
For a given distances between two cities ,we have to find distance between each two cities and create a matrix

Question:
----------
If input =

4

3 2 7

This means there are 4 cities and

3 = difference between city 1 and 2

2 = difference between city  2 and 3

7 = difference between city 3 and 4

Develop a python programmme to output NxN matrix to display each distances between each cities

Output 

0 3 5 12

3 0 2 9

5 2 0 7

12 9 7 0

Explain row 1

0 - distance between C1 and C1

3 - distance bet. C1 and C2

5 - distance bet. C1 and C3

12 - distance bet. C1 and C4
